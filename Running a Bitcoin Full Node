Join us for a brief presentation on how to run your own Bitcoin full node.
We'll briefly run through how to set up a node, different forms and types of nodes and how they support the network and help to enhance your privacy. 
This will be followed by related and unrelated Bitcoin talk with attendees for the majority of the evening.
